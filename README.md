# Use Playwright For Web Scraping with Python
The task requires developing a frontend-backend solution. The backend developer's role is to create the backend solution and use minimal frontend if necessary. The requirements are as follows:

1. Develop a Python module that utilizes the playwright-browser to scrape company details from G2Crowd, using a provided CSV of G2Crowd URLs (URL shortening service). The output should be structured, such as a JSON or CSV file with fields and values.
2. Additional considerations include:
   1. Making all API calls asynchronous.
   2. Implementing appropriate exception handling throughout the code.
